    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds (800 grams) chicken thighs and drumsticks</li>
        <li>1 small lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons vegetable oil, clarified butter, ghee, or niter kibbeh, fragrant butter</li>
        <li>6 large red onions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons berbere spice mix, more or less to taste</li>
        <li>1 (1-inch) piece) fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 to 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>11 ounces (450 milliliters) water, or chicken stock, add as needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garam masala</li>
        <li>6 large hard-boiled eggs, peeled</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> <h2>Step 1:</h2><p>Marinate the chicken pieces in the lemon juice. Refrigerate, covered, while you cook 
                                the onions. </p></li>
        <li> <h2>Step 2:</h2> <p>Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil or butter in a large Dutch oven, or other 
            heavy-duty pot over medium-low heat, add the onions and cook gently for an hour until reduced 
            into a sweet paste. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.</p> </li>
        <li> <h2>Step 3:</h2> <p>Add the remaining 4 tablespoons oil or butter. Add the berbere spice,
             followed by the ginger and garlic and fry until fragrant. More berbere spice can be added 
             depending on how much heat is desired. </p></li>
        <li> <h2>Step 4:</h2> <p>Add the chicken pieces to the pot along with the stock and 1 teaspoon salt.
             Simmer on low heat for 40 minutes until the chicken is cooked. Halfway through, sprinkle the
              garam masala over the wat and continue cooking, stirring occasionally.</p></li>
        <li><h2>Step 5:</h2><p>Add the boiled eggs to the wat and stir to coat completely. Adjust the 
            seasoning with salt, if desired. Serve the doro wat on top of injera to enjoy it the traditional
             way. Alternatively, this can be enjoyed with Indian flatbread or rice.</p></li>
